# Topological Sort with Cycle Detection (C++)

This project implements **Topological Sorting** in directed graphs with integrated **Cycle Detection** using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.  
The graph is read from a file (`graph.txt`) as an adjacency matrix, then converted into an adjacency list for processing.  
If the graph contains a cycle, the program will detect it and report that no topological ordering is possible.

## ‚ú® Features
- Reads graph input from a file (`graph.txt`)
- Detects cycles in directed graphs
- Prints a valid topological order if no cycle exists
- Implemented using **DFS**, **Stack**, and **Color Marking Technique** (`WHITE`, `GRAY`, `BLACK`)

## üì• Input Format (`graph.txt`)
- **Line 1**: Number of vertices `n`  
- **Next n lines**: Adjacency matrix (`n x n`)  
  - `1` ‚Üí there is a directed edge `i -> j`  
  - `0` ‚Üí no edge
